        <h2>Strengths and Limitations in terms of Learning and Career Development:</h2>

        <p>Being a good listener and enjoying hearing out the ideas of other should help me with team-based activities and when engaging with instructors. Making sure you have a clear understanding of what an employer/ client are wanting developed is critical to producing the right product/ solution for their needs.</p>
        <p>Being detail oriented allows me to consider what exactly needs to be done to reach a goal. Breaking things down to small manageable chunks is important (especially when working in teams) though ill needs to make sure I’m not focusing too much time on unimportant details. I think ranking tasks by important vs urgency could be a useful tactic for me.</p>
        <p>Along with being a good listener I also try to take a logical approach to everything I do. These skills together often allow me to mediate situations between people as I’ll listen to the issue, each of their takes on it, and try to find a solution or compromise that is best suited for the project and both parties.</p>
        <p>Often, I’m quite quiet while working, I spend a lot of time thinking about the problem at hand and weighing up different approaches. This can be mistaken for slacking, but it is how I work to make sure the contributions I’m making are going to be worthwhile. I’m also someone who needs to be confident about their approach to a task otherwise it’s easy for me to get disinterested and lose motivation.</p>
        <p>Public speaking is something I’ve avoided in general. Being the centre of attention (especially around people I’m not familiar with) has never been much of a draw to me. I’m more of an introverted person and like to listen and observe others and their ideas but broadcasting myself I find draining.</p>
        <p>Self-regulation, making sure I do things I’ve committed to in a timely manner has and is a struggle of mine. Building habits and routines helps deal with this, though I have to be careful not to take too much on at once or I overwhelm myself and things can start falling apart.</p>
        
        <h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity:</h2>
        <p>I’m an NZ European male that grew up in a single parent household. I think the resilience I witnessed growing up with one person financially, physically and emotionally supporting/ running a family is astonishing and the ways in which we were able to do so taught me many valuable lessons, forming the values I hold today.</p>
        <p>These were shown to me through many simple day to day experiences such as showing restraint when shopping and buying only what was needed. Taking the time to budget and make sure you are putting yourself in a stable financial position or following through on promises made and being kind to others, to behave like a productive/ functioning member of society even when things are tough.</p>
        <p>My friends and those I’ve chosen to surround myself with also compliment and back up these values for the most part and I believe that is why I value their friendship so much. Sharing similar morals and values allows us to function with unspoken expectations and be on the same page about things, helping each other stick to our core values and not erode each other's moral as some people do.</p>

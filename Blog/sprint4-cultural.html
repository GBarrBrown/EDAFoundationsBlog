  <h2>Your Brain: Neuroplasticity and Fixed vs Growth Mindsets</h2>

  <div class="blog-post">
    <h3>Neuroplasticity and Malleable Intelligence - </h3>

    <p>
      <em>“Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organizing of connections between neurons in our brains”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Malleable intelligence is the idea that the brain is not static, it is constantly creating and dissolving connections, reshaping itself. 
      Research has shown that those with an understanding of malleable intelligence achieve better than their peers in school AND that when the idea of malleable intelligence is actively taught to students they too begin to perform better than their peers who still lack this knowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Part of this is because it tells students that through numerous attempts and hard work they will be able to reshape and train their brains in ways they previously thought impossible. 
      Esentially giving hope (backed by scientific reason) to people that they can learn a new and challenging concept, who would otherwise have made the assumption they are simply not capable. 
      You can increase neuroplasticity through repetition, reframing work into a more relatable context and education on malleable intelligence.

    <h3>Fixed vs Growth Mindsets</h3>
    <p>
      In a Fixed Mindset a person believes that their quialities such as intelligence or talent are fixed. 
      That what you are born with is what you have to work with and there is not much point in perserveering when things aren't working out. 
      They're focused on the idea of natural talent taking you in a direction that is appropriate for the skills you currently have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas in a Gowth Mindset a person understands that those qualities are capable of being developed through hardwork and dedication or reframing the way you are looking at a problem. 
      To them their current intelligence and talent are just starting points and don't necessarily dictate where they will end up as they can mould themselves into something different. 
      This approach helps foster an appreciation for learning and respect for the process others have gone through to become much more than who they started out as. 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      In the table below are some contrasts between behaviours and viewpoints of those working with Fixed vs Growth Mindsets.

        <td>More likely to choose easier tasks and put in minimal effort - if talent is fixed, why bother trying to improve?</td>

      </tr>

        <td>Likely to give up when facing obstacles</td>
        <td>View obstacles as a chance to experiment and solve problems</td>

        <td>Focus is on a journey of continual improvement</td>

        <td>Creative risks are a way to innovate and improve</td>

    <h3>The Idea of 'Not Yet'</h3>
    <p>
      When observing students it's been found that those who don't quite meet the mark and recieve a grade of 'Not Yet' over that of the classic 'Fail' respond in a much more positive manner and are more likely to succeed next time round. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because of the connetation that is associated with each word. 
      'Fail' bluntly states that you did not reach the mark and only refers to your poor performance, while 'Not Yet' suggests that that you are on your way to reaching the mark and leads students to focus on the future attempt when they are at the mark and what more they need to do to get there. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of recieving 'Not Yet' grades over 'Fail' work well when paired with teaching of Growth Mindsets.  
      The Growth Mindset is going to acknowledge the things you did right along the way give you the resilience you need to get back out there and give it another crack and fill in your blanks. 
      Whereas a Fixed Mindset, from the point of failure can lead to believing that because you don’t have what it takes to get there now you never will. 
      You'd be immediately rulling out the possibility of improvement by jumping to the conclusion that nothing could be gained from more work or tackling the problem differently. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was surprised and fascinated at what all this research has shown, just by understanding that you can do better allows for more drive and resilience when it comes to tough problems. 
        I’m glad that I now know a bit more about how the mind works and that if I transition towards more of a Growth Mindset I’ll be putting myself in a better position to tackle my studies and life.

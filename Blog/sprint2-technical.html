        <h2>Best Practices Asscoiated with Using Classes and ID's</h2>

        <p>Both classes and ID's allow you to link to a set of styling instructions - stored in a CSS file,  to elements (objects and sections) on your page. This can be used to easily keep a consistent theme across a page and or site.</p>
        <p>You can link any number of elements on your page to any number of classes, and if 2 clases have conflicting styling instruction - One saying make Box-A red, the other saying green, whichever class comes further down your CSS file takes precidence.</p>

        <p>Where the difference lies between Classes and ID's is that an ID is like a single use Class. You can only pass an individual ID once on a page. Part of them being unique (tied to a single element per page) is that you can reference the ID and have the browser jump to the section of the page that element appears on (very useful for page navigation).</p>
        <p>When deciding whether to make a set of styling instructions in your CSS file into a Class or ID think - Am I using or going to use this set again on the same page? If so make a class. If it's a unique element that there will only ever be one of either a Class or an ID will be fine. And if you want users to be able to jump to a specific element use an ID</p>
        <p>Unlike classes an element can only have one ID assigned to it, but that doesn't mean you cant assign classes to it aswell. Maybe You want something styled the same as a class you've already made, AND want to be able to jump to it. Easy, use both!</p>

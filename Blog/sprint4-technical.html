      <h3>The Dreaded Error Message</h3>
      <p>
        In one of my tasks I needed do some work with objects. 
        Objects in code are similar to objects in real life in the sense that you refer to them by a name and associate certain preperties with them. 
        If you made an object to represent a ball, you might call it - <code>'ballObj'</code> and give it a property - <code>'shape'</code> with the value - <code>'round'</code>.
        <br/><br/>
        Now in most cases in code you use <code>=</code> to signify you want to tie a value to what is called a variable (eg. <code>round</code>), a container for that value (eg. <code>shape</code>). 
        But in the case of objects you use something different called key-value pairs. 
        These make it easier to do certain things with objects that I wont get into but just know that with objects you dont use <code>=</code> to link the two together you use <code>:</code>. 
        <br/><br/>
        This slipped my mind while working away and when I came to test my code... Errors ensued. 
        On first glance it seemed my code was all written correctly. 
        I wasn't missing any brackets - <code>( )</code> or semi-colons - <code>;</code>, which are the usual culprates. 
        <br/><br/>
        So I checked out what the error messages had to say <code style="color:red">"Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid shorthand property initializer"</code>.
        It was telling me I'd used the wrong syntax <code>=</code> instead of <code>:</code> when writing my code. 
        Oops. Quick fix, just had to change the one character and my code worked as intended.
        <br/><br/>
        I let the differences in object syntax slip my mind while coding and was genuinly stumped as to why my code wouldn't run. 
        But by checking out the error message it became clear where I'd gone wrong. 
        This was a good reminder to myself and is to others, that even if you've learnt something in the past, you can't gaurentee you'll get it right everytime from then on out, we all make mistakes. 
        But taking the time to figure out where you went wrong can help lessen the chances you'll make it again in the future. 
        And remember - The <code style="color:red">Error Message</code> might seem daunting but it often has some great insight into what's gone wrong.

      <h3>Elegant Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        There was a function I needed to make that could take a string and capitalize the first letter of every word. 
        To the best of my knowledge JavaScript doesnt have a built in way to do this, however there is a function that will capitalize everything you give it. 
        So I figured I needed a way to pass that function <code>.toUpperCase()</code> only the first letter of all the words in my sentence.
        <br/><br/>
        I managed to do this by taking the sentence (stored as a string) and using <code>.split(" ")</code> ,creating an array from the string with each word (detected by the presence of a blank space) in its own cell. 
        From here I ran a function taking the first character in each cell of the array <code>cell[0]</code>, capitalizing it using the <code>.toUpperCase()</code> function and then pairing it back together using string concatenation <code>"H" + "ello"  -> "Hello"</code> with the respective word minus that first character using <code>cell.splice(1)</code>. 
        All of that was controlled by a map which allows you to call functions on each item in a collection, which in this case was the array made from the original string. 
        After all the words (cells) had been run through they were joined back into a string again using the <code>.join(" ")</code> function, connecting the arrays cells with a sapace be each.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process ran like this:
        <br/><code>"hello world"  ->  ["hello", "world"]  ->  H + ello  &  W + orld  ->  ["Hello", "World"]  ->  "Hello World"</code>
        
        <br/><br/>
        This is the actual code I wrote:
        <pre>
          <code>function capitalize (str){ 
            return str.split(" ").map(x => x[0].toUpperCase() + x.slice(1)).join(" ");
          }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>

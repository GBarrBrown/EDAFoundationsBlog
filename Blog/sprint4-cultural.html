  <h3>Neuroplasticity and Malleable Intelligence - </h3>

  <p>
    <em>“Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organizing of connections between neurons in our brains”</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Malleable intelligence is the idea that the brain is not static, it is constantly creating and dissolving connections, reshaping itself. 
    Research has shown that those with an understanding of malleable intelligence achieve better than their peers in school AND that when the idea of malleable intelligence is actively taught to students they too begin to perform better than their peers. 
    Part of this is because it tells students that through numerous attempts and hard work they will be able to reshape and train their brains in ways they previously thought impossible. 
    You can increase neuroplasticity through repetition, having work put into a relatable context and education on malleable intelligence.

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>
        In the table below are some contrasts between behaviours and viewpoints of those working with Fixed vs Growth Mindsets.
    </p>
    <table border="1" class="bordered-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Fixed Mindset</th>
        <th>Growth Mindset</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Abilities are innate and unchangeable</td>
        <td>Improvement comes through practice</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Failure is permanent</td>
        <td>Failure is a chance to lean or pivot</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>View critical feedback as a personal attack</td>
        <td>Chance to improve and develope new systems</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>More likely to choose easier tasks and put in minimal effort - if talent is fixed, why bother trying to improve?</td>
        <td>More likely to take on challenging tasks - see them as an opportunity to improve or learn</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Likely to give up when facing obstacles</td>
        <td>View obstacles as a chance to experiment and solve problems</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Focus is on measurable accomplishments</td>
        <td>Focus is on a journey of continual improvement</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Less likely to take creative risks</td>
        <td>Creative risks are a way to innovate and improve</td>
      </tr>

      <h3>The Idea of 'Not Yet'</h3>
      <p>
          The idea or ‘Not yet’ being at a certain level vs failing to achieve at that level can be the difference between fostering a growth vs fixed mindset. 
          The growth mindset is going to acknowledge the things you did right along the way give you the resilience you need to get back out there and give it another crack. 
          A fixed mindset, from the point of failure can lead to believing you’ll never achieve and that you don’t have what it takes to get there, and you never will. 
      </p>
      <p>
          I was surprised and fascinated at what all this research has shown, just by understanding that you can do better allows for more drive and resilience when it comes to tough problems. 
          I’m glad that I now know a bit more about how the mind works and that if I transition towards more of a Growth Mindset I’ll be putting myself in a better position to tackle my studies and life.

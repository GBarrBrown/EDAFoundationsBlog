    <h3>What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Having aptitude in assessing the emotions of yourself and others and beiong able to act accordingly to those indications. </li>
            <li>Your ability to deal with emotions</li>
        </ul>
        EQ is about self awareness - being aware of how we are feeling in certain situations, awareness of how others are feeling. Self management - how well we can get ourselves to respond effectively to that awareness, and management of others who may or may not be aware of their own emotional state.
        <br>
        EQ is important because it makes interpersonal interactions smoother as you can gague how a person is feeling without them having to directly tell you.
        <br>
        
        IQ is a approximate measure of a persons intelligence (ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills).

    <h3>Analogy to describe difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
        A way that I've found useful for describing the relationship between HTML and CSS is picture you're overall website as a house. 
        The structure, frame, general layout and generic content within is what HTML controls. 
        So far you have a pretty bland house, it has all the things you need, but they may not be in their ideal place or look the part. 
        Sure you could live here but its really just a house, and what we're after is a home. 
        This is where you could choose to bring in a stylist or designer. 
        They make small adjustments, change colours, swap out furnishings, and set appropriate themes for different rooms (You're unlikely to put carpet in the bathroom) and CSS is how we bring about these design changes to our website.

    <h3>Explain Control Flow and Loops</h3>
    <p>
        Control Flow - The Flow of a program is a representation of the order in which it executes (runs) different instructions, just like you would think of the flow of your day, the motions you go through, so does a computer program. 
        <br>
        There are different ways you can alter the flow of a program, one of those ways is through the use of 'conditional loops' - a block of code that is repeated until some condition the computer is checking is no longer met.

    <h3>The DOM</h3>
    <p>
            The DOM is your browsers internal representation of a webpage, created by taking the necesary HTML, CSS and JS files into account so it can understand what you are wanting displayed on the screen.
            DOM stands for Document Object Model, that's the general idea of what the DOM does. It takes your code maps it out like a family tree, basically whereever your code would normally indent or nest below another element in the tree diagram it would be considered a child of the upper element. 
            The cool thing about the DOM is that you can use scripting Languages (often times JavaScript) to manipulate your initial HTML, allowing you to alter content on your page or even allow users to alter content on their page.

    <h3>Difference Between Accessing Data from Arrays vs Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays are indexed, meaning each item in the array has a number associated with its placement in the array 0,1,2,3.. etc.
      You can use the name of the array followed by the items index number in square brackets [ ] to fetch the value in that position of the array. eg myArray[1]
      <br>
      Objects in JavaScript dont have indexs, they're made up of a collection of key-value pairs. To get the value from an object you use the name of the object followed by a dot (.) then the name of the key that value is associated with. eg friendsAges.peter --> 29
      You can also use bracket notation with objects (This is required in situations where key names include special characters or spaces), though most people use dot notation with objects.

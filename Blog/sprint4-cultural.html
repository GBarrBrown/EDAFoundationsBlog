  <h3>Neuroplasticity and Malleable Intelligence - </h3>

  <p>
    <em>“Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organizing of connections between neurons in our brains”</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Malleable intelligence is the idea that the brain is not static, it is constantly creating and dissolving connections, reshaping itself.
    Research has shown that those with an understanding of malleable intelligence achieve better than their peers in school AND that when the idea of malleable intelligence is actively taught to students they too begin to perform better than their peers.
    Part of this is because it tells students that through numerous attempts and hard work they will be able to reshape and train their brains in ways they previously thought impossible. 
    You can increase neuroplasticity through repetition, having work put into a relatable context and education on malleable intelligence.
